# TabScheduler
TabScheduler is a simple chrome extension which is able to automatically open a list of sites at specified time every day.

Do you read the news every morning? Or do you check your favorite comics everyday? Or running for an activity achievement in a game? Then add the site to TabScheduler's list and it will be opened for you automatically.

## Installation
I created this extension mainly for myself and I am not planning to add it to the chrome webstore for now. That being said you will need to install it through developer mode ([see how](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)).
